/*
   A separate implementation is provided for GNU environment, because in this environment
   the required functionality can be implemented as a macro. Using the macro gives a
   guarantee that there will be no unintended overhead in reading TSC value.

   For other environments the same code is put inside "static inline" function. Though
   it's HIGHLY probable that a compiler will make this code inline at the point of use,
   it is not strictly guaranteed.

   We could define a macro that would fit any environment. But the resulting macro would
   look strange from client perspective, because it would require arguments. So, for now
   the decision is to have a macro for GNU and a "static inline" function for all other
   environments.

   Need to think about introducing "reordering-safe" version of the macro. At the moment
   of writing GCC didn't provide any absolute non-reordering guarantees for ASM
   statements. Reordering must be controlled by specifying explicit dependencies (like
   "I can modify an arbitrary memory location").
   Without proper dependencies in place ASM statements can be potentially reordered with
   (almost) any surrounding code (including other ASM statements).
   Current version of the macro (that doesn't have reordering-blocking dependencies) can
   be protected from reordering by using various types of barriers around it in the client
   code. But that should be done with caution. Some direct approaches may not just work as
   expected. E.g. another ASM statement with some "barrier" instruction inside may not
   work, because it can be potentially reordered with TSC-retrival ASM statement (again,
   unless proper dependencies are in place). C-language-supported barriers will work best
