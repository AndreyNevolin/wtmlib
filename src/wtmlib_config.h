   A threshold used to verify statistical significance of calculated TSC delta range. Here
   "TSC delta" is a shift between two TSC counters running on different CPUs - some CPU of
   interest and some reference CPU. To calculate this "delta", TSC probes are collected
   concurrently on both CPUs. These probes are sequentially ordered. From statistical
   significance perspective, the best case is when the probes collected on one CPU
   alternate neatly with the probes collected on the other CPU. The worst case is when in
   the sequence of probes first come all the probes collected on one CPU and then come all
   the probes collected on the other CPU. In this case, "TSC delta" cannot be calculated
   at all.
   In general, given a sequence of TSC probes, it may be possible to produce several
   independent estimations of a range of values that "TSC delta" can take. These ranges
   (if any) are then intersected into single final estimation. The more independent
   estimations can be extracted from the sequence of TSC probes, the more accurate and
   statistically significant final result we can get. The value defined below is a number
   of independent "delta" range estimations that a TSC probe sequence must allow for the
   final (combined) estimation to be trusted

#define WTMLIB_EVAL_TSC_MONOTCTY_PROBES_COUNT 1000
/*
   A threshold used to assess reliability (statistical significance) of a result of TSC
   monotonicity evaluation

   Assessment of statistical significance makes sense in case of positive result only.
   In case of negative result it is known for sure that collected one after another
   (possibly on different CPUs) TSC values do can decrease. But if the result is positive,
   it cannot be said with 100% confidence that collected one after another (possibly on
   different CPUs) TSC values will never decrease. It can only be said that "with some
   level of certainty they will not decrease".
   This "level of certainty" depends on how many TSC probes were collected on each CPU and
   how well the probes collected on different CPUs are mixed in the sequence.
   The value defined below deals with the degree of mixing. A criterion for good mixing
   used in this library is the following:
     - it must be possible to find two probes in the sequence that were collected on the
       same CPU (let's call it CPU0). This requirement is always met
     - between these two probes there must be at least one probe collected on each (!)
       other CPU. Probes collected on CPU0 may also be there, but that's not a requirement
   So, for a result of monotonicity evaluation to be trusted, in a complete sequence of
   TSC probes there must exist a sub-sequence of successive (!) probes that satisfies the
   two conditions above. If several non-overlapping sub-sequences of that kind can be
   found, then positive result of monotinicity evaluation is even more trusted. The
   threshold defined below specifies exactly the number of such sub-sequences. A result of
   monotonicity evaluation is considered statistically significant if the specified amount
   of sub-sequences with the indicated properties can be discovered in the complete
   sequence of TSC probes

/*
   The number of measurements to do when calculating how many times TSC counter ticks
   during a second-long time period

   Relating TSC changes to system time changes is tricky because TSC and system time
   cannot be measured simultaneously (at least on the same CPU). Some factors that can
   affect the time gap between the measurements are: system call overhead, interrupts,
   and context switches. WTMLIB accounts for these negative effects by doing multiple
   measurements and applying some basic statistics to the measured values

	 second but with the specified time period. Then tsc-per-this-time-period is converted
	 into tsc-per-second

   The "modulus" defined below is used to divide TSC ticks to be converted into two parts:
       - a part which (roughly) corresponds to a multiple of "modulus" seconds
       - and the rest
   Then the parts are converted to nanoseconds using different (but simple) procedures.
   The results are summed up to produce the final value.

   The accuracy of the conversion depends on the value of the "modulus"
